# WD.Portfolio
# <Portfolio>

## Description

My motivation for this project is to create a new portfolio that shows off what I have learned In this Bootcamp. I will continue to work and add to this project throughout the course untill I have a polished understanding of the front & back end of web development and be able to showcase that here through my work.
By having this Portfolio available I will have a source of information regaurding my skill level that is easy to navigate to potential buisness looking to hire.
I learned alot through this project by ways of trial and error, testing new features and getting more comfortable with being able to put pieces together.
- What did you learn?
